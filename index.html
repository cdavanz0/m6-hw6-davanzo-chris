			<p> Hello, and welcome to my website!</p> 
			<p> My name is Christopher.</p>  
			<p> This page was created as part of my course learning to how to write HTML mark-up and understand web design. I am a grad student at the University of Florida studying Political Communications.</p> 
			<p> More generally, I am trying to learn more in the aim of advancing my career in media and communications.</p>

			<h2>About</h2>
				<p> I graduated from high school in 2015 and then studied at Florida State University until 2018, receiving a bachelor's degree in English and Political Science. My area of specialization was creative writing. I spent the last several years learning the elements of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. My time at FSU cemented the passion I have for storytelling and problem solving creatively.</p> 
				<p> After graduating, I temporarirly relocated and became a team reporter for a college baseball team. Shortly thereafter, I worked as intern for a film festival and did social media for a small film and commerical production company. In 2019, I was the Marketing Coordinator for a credit union in Gainesville.</p> 
				<p> Since 2020, I have been the Communication Specialist for my town's local Community Foundation and Nonprofit Resource Center. </p>
